              | Surrealism is based on the belief in the superior reality of certain forms of
              | previously neglected associations, in the omnipotence of dream, in the
              | disinterested play of thought. It tends to ruin once and for all other psychic
              | mechanisms and to substitute itself for them in solving all the principal
              | problems of life.

            | There are two forms of Surrealism, automatism and verism. Automatism deals with
            | the suppression of the consciousness, to use the subconscious. There is more of a
            | focus on feeling, and automatism is unburdened with meaning. It has been
            | described as "dictation of thoughts without control of the mind". Automatist
            | paintings often have biomorphic (ameba-like) shapes, and give off a dreamlike
            | feeling. Yves Tanguy's paintings are a perfect example of this form, like such as
            | Multiplication of the Arcs.
          p
            | The veristic branch of Surrealism allows the subconscious to surface in order to
            | interpret meaning. It uses images as a link between abstract spiritual realities
            | and real forms of the natural world. In other words, veristic paintings are much
            | closer to reality than automatist paintings. They hold some truth, portraying
            | recognizable scenes and objects that are taken out of natural context, resulting
            | in a dreamscape. Salvador Dali is the most well known artist who portrays
            | identifiable objects in strange settings. His "hand painted dream photographs"
            | are so meticulously detailed, they almost look real, although they are so
            | fantastic and dreamlike. He drew upon the terrors of his childhood to put his
            | nightmares on canvas. Another veristic artist is Rene Magritte (The Human
            | Condition, Portrait, and Time Transfixed are good examples of veristic
            | Surrealism). The Human Condition I and II portray a canvas which lines up
            | perfectly with the landscape behind it. Reality and the painting are so close, it
            | makes you question the difference.
